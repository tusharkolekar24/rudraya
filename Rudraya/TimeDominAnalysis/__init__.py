            Summary:
            ---------- 
            A time-domain graph shows how a signal changes with time, whereas a frequency-domain graph shows how much of the signal lies
            within each given frequency band over a range of frequencies.

            It consists of statistical dimensional and non-dimensional time-domain features such as Peak Amplitude, Mean Amplitude, 
            root mean square (RMS), Skewness, Kurtosis, Peak-to-Peak,Crest Factor, Variance, Standard Deviation, Impulse Factor,
            Margin factor, shape factor,Clearance Factor of the raw or pre-processed signals.
